This code is written in MATLAB, and implements the SD filter [1].

# Usage:
  - Run `runSDF_scale_space.m` for scale-space filtering
  - Run `runSDF_depthsr.m` for depth upsampling
  
## Notes:
  * The bandwidth parameters, $\mu$ and $\nu$, and the regularization parameter, $\lambda$, are set to different values due to the normalization.
  * Texture removal can be done by substituting the static guidance image **g** in `runSDF_scale_space.m` with the Gaussian filtered version of the input image **f**.
  * The code is provided for academic use only. Use of the code in any commercial or industrial related activities is prohibited. 
  * If you use our code, please cite the paper.

* This code uses some graph functions in the [Graph Analysis Toolbox] (http://eslab.bu.edu/software/graphanalysis/).
* We use the Graz data set [2] for depth upsampling.
